    # 
    # Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

    # - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

    # 
    #   For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`
    # 
    # - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.
    # 
    # - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.
    # 
    #   Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**
    # 
    # - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.
    # 
    # - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.
    # 
    #   Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.
    # 
    # - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.
    # 
    #   Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

    # 
    #   For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

    #   Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**
    # 
    # - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.
    # 
    # - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.
    # 
    #   Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. 
    # 
    # When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.
    # 
    # It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.
    # 
    # If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope.

    #   Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**
    #
